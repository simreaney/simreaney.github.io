I teach hydrology across the different levels within the BSc Geography and the MSc Risk in the department of Geography at Durham University. This teaching covers field based measurement, theory of hydrological processes and simulation modelling of catchments and flood inundation.

BSc Level One: Introduction to Geographical Research
======
I teach catchment hydrological process measurement on the level on field trip to Portugal, the following computer based practicals and projects. In the field, I teach the measurement of rainfall infiltration, microtopography and runoff.  

BSc Level Two: Fluvial Systems
======
On the level two fluvial systems module I teach the hillslope and catchment hydrological processes including rainfall, evaporation, runoff, infiltration and ground water and integrated catchment management. The management includes both diffuse pollution and flood hazard reduction.    

BSc Level Three: Catchment Modelling for Management
======
Catchment Modelling for Management module covers both catchment simulation modelling and flood inundation modelling. This combination enables students to link together projections of future climate change with how the catchment system will convert the rainfall in to floods and low flow. The projected changes to the flood flows are then modelled with a 2D hydraulic model to consider the change in both the hazard and the risk to the community. This modelling is all framed within an uncertainty estimation framework.

MSc Hydro-meteorological Hazards
======
The Hydro-meteorological Hazard module is part of the MSc in Risk and I teach catchment hydrology, catchment simulation and flood inundation modelling and flood risk mitigation. The flood risk mitigation includes both hard engineered and nature based solutions (natural flood risk management) based approaches.
