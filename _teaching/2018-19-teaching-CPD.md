I teach two CPD courses, one on catchment hydrological modelling and one on fine scale topographic mapping with drones.

CPD Catchment Modelling
======
The three day CPD course in catchment hydrological modelling teaches the application of a lumped model to a UK catchment and includes the issues associated with model predictive uncertainty. The developed model is then used for predicted the potential impacts of projected climate change on the student's choice of catchment.

CPD Drone mapping
======
This course covers in one day how to capture imagery from a drone to enable the creation of fine scale topographic data, how to process the images into the datasets and how to use the data to give insights into the hydrological and sediment processes.
