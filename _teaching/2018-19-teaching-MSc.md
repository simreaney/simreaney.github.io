I teach hydrological hazards on the MSc Risk in the department of Geography at Durham University. 

MSc Hydro-meteorological Hazards
======
The Hydro-meteorological Hazard module is part of the MSc in Risk and I teach catchment hydrology, catchment simulation and flood inundation modelling and flood risk mitigation. The flood risk mitigation includes both hard engineered and nature based solutions (natural flood risk management) based approaches.
