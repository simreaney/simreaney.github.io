Flood waters move sediments and the sediments move the flood waters. This feedback between the hydrological and geomorphic processes needs to be considered across spatial and temporal scales leading to the use of a range of modelling and analysis tools. This presentation will cover how we can determine the origin of flood waters within catchments and how flood flows are projected to change the floodplains in the Nepalese Himalayas.  

A key question in understanding flood systems is ‘where do flood waters originate?’. SCIMAP-Flood, a reduced complexity tool, is designed to map the origins of flood waters within a catchment. It identifies critical source areas for flood waters, where there is both a source of flood water and an effective hydrological pathway to the river channel. The volume of flood water generated is defined by the rainfall or snowmelt, the local runoff coefficient, and the travel times to the point of impact. The local runoff coefficient can be based on land cover, soils/geology, or calibrated to observations. Hydrological connectivity is determined using the Network Index. As land cover changes and rainfall patterns associated with flood events vary for each event, a range of rainfall patterns are considered. By considering these drivers, the resulting maps show potential flood water origins and the associated prediction uncertainty.  

Projections of climate change in Nepal show an intensification of the monsoon rainfalls and these changes have the potential to increase the magnitude of flood events. The SPHY Hydrological model was applied to the Karnali river catchment (40,000 km2) and projections of river flow under 12 different GCMs were made. These flows were then applied to the Caesar-LISFLOOD flood inundation and geomorphic change model for a 600 km2 area on the alluvial fan at the outlet from the catchment. The simulations show how the spatial distribution of water and flood inundation may change in the future.
