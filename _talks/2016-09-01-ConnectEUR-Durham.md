abstract: "This [poster](http://simreaney.github.io/files/COST-connectivity-modelling-tools-poster-Reaney-2015-A0-copy.pdf) was presented at the Connecteur (COST action ES1306) workshop in Durham, Sept 2015. It gives a brief description of the Network Index of hydrological connectivity, as used within SCIMAP, the connectivity calculations from within the full distributed rainfall runoff model CRUM3 and the hydroAgents approach to tracing flows. These are the modelling tools that I use or have developed to study hydrological connectivity."
