I am a catchment hydrologist who works across flood hazards and water quality degradation in temperate, tropical and mountain environments. My research aims to integrate novel field measurement with innovative analysis and simulation modelling to enable new insights into catchment hydrological functioning and new approaches to managing the environment. Most recently, new field data has included working collaboratively to build the most detailed water quality time series from a grassland agricultural system in the UK, a new hydro-meteorological monitoring network in Java and extensive flood impact and river form mapping using helicopter-based photogrammetry in Nepal. This information is being used to address scientific questions of:
* how the landscape and weather effect the movement of water and nutrients (N and P)? 
* how rainfall storm structure effects flood generation?
* the controls of hydrological connectivity related to flood water at the landscape scale?

My work has often been undertaken with stakeholders, including Defra, the Environment Agency and River Trusts in the UK, and through the co-development of the research questions and approaches I have developed tools and software that is routinely used for catchment management. The main tool is the [SCIMAP](http://www.scimap.org.uk) diffuse pollution risk mapping approach that is widely used in the UK and overseas. This work was part of an impact case study in 2015. I have also written the CRUM3 catchment hydrological model that has been used for natural flood risk management and water resources assessment with local flood action groups in a series of MRes, PhD and other projects.
