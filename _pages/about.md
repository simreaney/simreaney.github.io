I am an Associate Professor in the [Department of Geography](https://www.dur.ac.uk/research/directory/staff/?mode=staff&id=2325) and the Co-Director of the [Institute of Hazard, Risk and Resilience](https://www.durham.ac.uk/research/institutes-and-centres/hazard-risk-resilience/) at [Durham University](https://www.dur.ac.uk/), UK. As a catchment hydrologist, I work across flood hazards and water quality degradation in temperate, tropical and mountain environments. My research integrates analysis and simulation modelling with novel field measurement to enable new insights into catchment hydrological functioning and new approaches to managing the environment. Most recently, new field data has included working collaboratively to build the most detailed water quality time series from a grassland agricultural system, a new hydro-meteorological monitoring network and extensive mapping of flood impacts and river form using helicopter-based photogrammetry. This information is being used to address scientific questions of:
* How does the landscape and weather effect diffuse pollution of sediment and nutrients?
* How does the spatial and temporal structure of rainfall affect flood hazard generation?
* How do can the issues of floods and diffuse pollution be reduced by working at the landscape scale with nature based solutions and natural flood risk management?
* How does hydrological connectivity affect flood generation at the landscape scale?

I am currently working on flood hazards in Java, Indonesia, in collaboration with the Bandung Institute of Technology with the focus of developing an effective hyper-local flood early warning system  I am working in Nepal on flood hazards and how the can be linked to innovate insurance products. Within the UK, I am working on how the SCIMAP toolset can be expanded to consider flood hazards as well as sediments, nutrients and microbial pollution. My work has often been undertaken with stakeholders, including Defra, the Environment Agency and River Trusts in the UK, and through the co-development of the research questions and approaches I have developed tools and software that is routinely used for catchment management. The main tool is the [SCIMAP](http://www.scimap.org.uk) diffuse pollution risk mapping approach that is widely used in the UK and overseas. I have also written the CRUM3 fully distributed catchment hydrological model that has been used for water resources assessment and natural flood risk management with local flood action groups in a series of MRes, PhD and other projects.
