Work experience
======
## Co-Director of the Institute of Hazard, Risk and Resilience (IHRR)
2020 - to date
Institute of Hazard, Risk and Resilience, Durham University, United Kingdom

## Associate Professor in Catchment Hydrology
2020 - to date
Department of Geography, Durham University, United Kingdom
In this role, I am focusing on the combination of diffuse pollution and flood hazards in a wide range of environments.  This work will continue to develop the catchment modelling and SCIMAP toolkit to be applicable to a wider range of issues and environments.
I am teaching on both the BSc Geography and MSc Risk within the Geography department in Durham. I teach on catchment and flood simulation modelling and on hydrological processes.

## Assistant Professor in Catchment Hydrology
2012 - 2020
Within this role I worked on catchment hydrological processes including climate change, flood hazards and diffuse pollution. This work was largely focused on the UK and much work was structured around the Defra Eden DRC project, for which I was I Co-Investigator. This project looked at how to manage the landscape differently to reduce diffuse pollution whilst minimising impacts on farm business. I worked on the development of the SCIMAP diffuse pollution risk mapping toolkit.
I also started to test the approaches developed in the UK on flood source mapping and simulation modelling to new sites including Nepal and Java, Indonesia.  


## RCUK Post-Doctoral Research Fellow
2007 - 2012
Department of Geography, Durham University, United Kingdom

I held an RCUK postdoctoral research fellowship in the Institute of Hazard and Risk and Resilience and the Department of Geography at Durham University. The main theme of my research was hazards and risks related to water and I focused on the hazard that has the greatest capability to cause widespread impacts – climate change. These potential impacts were approached through better understanding of catchment hydrological processes and the use of simulation modelling techniques to determine how the system may change under projected futures.  I investigated how projected climate change may alter the hydrological functioning of catchments and how these changes may affect flooding, drought and diffuse pollution delivery to water courses.

## Post-Doctoral Research Associate
2005-2007
Department of Geography, Durham University, United Kingdom.

I worked on a NERC funded project to develop the SCIMAP diffuse pollution risk mapping toolset. This work involved terrain analysis development within open source GIS systems and the engagement with stakeholders, both within the catchments and Defra.

## Environmental Scientist and Visiting Researcher at the University of Leeds
2002 - 2005
Cascade Consulting, Manchester, UK.

I worked on a UK Water Industry Research (UKWIR) funded project on the potential impact of projected climate change on water quality for UK Rivers. This work involved the development of water quality models for nitrogen (NH<sub>4</sub> and NO<sub>3</sub>) and dissolved oxygen.

## Research Assistant, King’s College London, UK.
1998-1999

I worked on an EU funded research project, MODULUS, to develop a hydrological simulation model for semi-arid environments. This model was applied to southern Spain and Greece.
