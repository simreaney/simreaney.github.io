I am involved in a new research project starting this autumn. The project is called 'BIOPICCC' - **B**uilt **I**nfrastructure for **O**lder **P**eople **i**n **C**onditions of **C**limate **C**hange. The project as a whole is looking at mapping those parts of the UK which are likely to be most affected by climate change, and which have the highest concentrations of  older people.  The project will involve examining the current preparedness of the built environment for elderly people, in the face of likely climate change. I am involved in producing the risk maps for heat waves, floods and storms for the UK.

The research is funded by [EPSRC](http://www.epsrc.ac.uk "EPSRC") under the Adaptation and Resilience to a Changing Climate programme and is a joint project between Durham University and [Heriot-Watt University](http://www.hw.ac.uk/).
