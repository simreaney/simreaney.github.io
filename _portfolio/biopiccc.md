'BIOPICCC' - **B**uilt **I**nfrastructure for **O**lder **P**eople **i**n **C**onditions of **C**limate **C**hange.
The project as a whole is looking at mapping those parts of the UK which are likely to be most affected by climate change, and which have the highest concentrations of older people.Â The project involved examining the current preparedness of the built environment for elderly people, in the face of likely climate change. I was involved in producing the risk maps for heat waves, cold waves, floods and storms for the UK.

The research was funded by [EPSRC](http://www.epsrc.ac.uk "EPSRC") under the Adaptation and Resilience to a Changing Climate programme and is a joint project between Durham University and [Heriot-Watt University](http://www.hw.ac.uk/).
